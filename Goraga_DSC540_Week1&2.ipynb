    "Multiple Experiments:\n",

    "Random Number Generation:\n",
    "A list of 100 random numbers was successfully generated, ensuring a diverse range of values for analysis.\n",
    "List Filtering:\n",
    "The filtering process effectively created a new list containing only numbers divisible by three, demonstrating the use of list comprehensions and conditional statements.\n",
    "Difference Calculation:\n",
    "The difference in lengths between the original list and the filtered list was calculated accurately for each experiment, providing insights into the distribution of numbers.\n",
    "Average Difference:\n",
    "The average difference in length, computed over three experiments, was approximately 69.67, indicating a consistent pattern in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The task of handling lists involved generating random numbers, filtering them based on divisibility by three, and analyzing the differences in list lengths across multiple experiments. Through systematic implementation and calculation, valuable insights were gained regarding the distribution of numbers and the effectiveness of the filtering process. This activity underscores the importance of list manipulation techniques and statistical analysis in data processing tasks."

A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!”'"

Then, loop over this iterator, and also use isinstance and assert to make sure that the return types are tuples. Also, use a single line of code involving dropwhile and lambda expressions to convert all the tuples to lists while dropping any leading zeros (for example, (0, 1, 2) becomes [1, 2]). Finally, write a function that takes a list like before and returns the actual number contained in it.\n",

Combine the preceding code into one block, and this time write a separate function where you will pass the list generated from dropwhile, and the function will return the whole number contained in the list. As an example, if you pass [1,2] to the function, it will return 12. Make sure that the return type is indeed a number and not a string. Although this task can be achieved using other tricks, you require that you treat the incoming list as a stack in the function and generate the number by reading the individual digits from the stack.\n"

    "Design Your Own CSV Parser\n",
    "\n",
    "A CSV file is something you will encounter a lot in your life as a data practitioner, A CSV is a comma-separated file where data from a tabular format is generally stored and separated using commas, although other characters can also be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this activity, you will be tasked with building a CSV reader and parser, Although it is a big task if you try to cover all use cases and edge cases, along with escape characters and all, for the sake of this small activity, you will keep the requirements small. you will assume that there is no escape character, meaning that if you use a comma at any place in your row, it means you are starting a new column. you will also assume that the only function you are interested in is to be able to read a CSV file line by line where each read will generate a new dict with the column names as keys and row names as values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Name Age Location\n",
    "\n",
    "Bob 24 California\n",
    "\n",
    "you can convert the data in the preceding table into a Python dictionary, which would\n",
    "look as follows: {\"Name\": \"Bob\", \"Age\": \"24\", \"Location\": \"California\"}:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Import zip_longest from itertools. Create a function to zip header, line and fillvalue=None.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Open the accompanying sales_record.csv file from the GitHub link by using r mode inside a with block and first check that it is opened.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Read the first line and use string methods to generate a list of all the column names.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Start reading the file. Read it line by line.\n",
    "\n",
    "5 Read each line and pass that line to a function, along with the list of the headers. The work of the function is to construct 2 dict out of these two and fill up the key: values. Keep in mind that a missing value should result in None."

    "The task involves designing a simple CSV parser capable of reading a CSV file line by line and converting each line into a dictionary with column names as keys and row values as values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Methodology and Implementation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Function Definitions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Two functions were defined:\n",
    "zip_header_line(header, line): Zips the header and line together using itertools.zip_longest, with None as the fill value.\n",
    "return_dict_from_csv_line(header, line): Constructs two dictionaries from the zipped header and line, where missing values result in None.\n",
    "CSV File Reading:\n",
    "\n",
    "The provided CSV file (sales_record.csv) was opened in read mode using a with statement to ensure proper file handling.\n",
    "The first line of the file was read to extract column names, which were then stored in a list.\n",
    "Parsing and Conversion:\n",
    "\n",
    "The file was read line by line, and each line was split into values using , as the delimiter.\n",
    "The return_dict_from_csv_line function was called to construct dictionaries with column names as keys and row values as values.\n",
    "Missing values were handled gracefully by assigning None.\n",
    "Output and Verification:\n",
    "\n",
    "The constructed dictionaries were printed to verify the parsing and conversion process.\n",
    "Additionally, file opening success and failure were checked and appropriate messages were printed.\n",
    "Results and Observations:\n",
    "File Opening and Parsing:\n",
    "\n",
    "The file (sales_record.csv) was successfully opened, and parsing began without errors.\n",
    "Each line of the CSV file was read and converted into dictionaries, demonstrating the effectiveness of the parsing algorithm.\n",
    "Data Conversion and Integrity:\n",
    "\n",
    "The parsing process effectively converted CSV data into dictionaries, maintaining data integrity and preserving column names.\n",
    "Missing values were handled appropriately by assigning None, ensuring consistent data representation.\n",
    "Functionality Verification:\n",
    "\n",
    "The constructed dictionaries were printed for verification, confirming that the CSV data was parsed correctly.\n",
    "Column names and corresponding row values were accurately captured in the dictionaries.\n",
    "Robustness and Limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "The parser implemented in this activity is simplistic and assumes no escape characters or complex CSV structures.\n",
    "It may not handle all edge cases or special characters present in real-world CSV files.\n",
    "\n",
    "The designed CSV parser successfully fulfills the requirements of reading a CSV file and converting its contents into dictionaries. While simplistic, it serves as a foundational implementation for handling basic CSV parsing tasks. Further enhancements could be made to handle more complex CSV structures and edge cases encountered in practical scenarios. Overall, the activity provides valuable experience in designing custom data parsing solutions tailored to specific requirements."

    "\n",
    "Title: Explorations in Data Analysis and Computation\n",
    "\n",
    "Introduction: \n",
    "\n",
    "Data analysis and computation are fundamental aspects of modern research, spanning various disciplines and industries. In this comprehensive report, we delve into four distinct tasks, each aimed at exploring different facets of data analysis and computation through Python programming. From statistical analysis to text mining and permutation generation to CSV parsing, these tasks offer valuable insights into the methodologies and applications of data-driven approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "Statement of the Problem: \n",
    "\n",
    "The primary objective across all tasks is to leverage Python programming to investigate and analyze different datasets, ranging from random number lists to literary texts and permutation sets. Each task poses unique challenges, including understanding the impact of divisibility on random number lists, identifying unique word occurrences in a literary work, generating permutations systematically, and parsing CSV data efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Results:\n",
    "\n",
    "Task 1: Exploring the Impact of Divisibility on Random Number Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "The average difference in length between randomly generated lists and lists containing only numbers divisible by three highlights the non-uniform distribution of divisible numbers within random lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "Task 2: Exploring Text Analysis: Unique Word Occurrences in \"Pride and Prejudice\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Analysis of unique word occurrences in \"Pride and Prejudice\" provides insights into vocabulary richness and usage patterns within the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Task 3: Analyzing Permutations: Generating Three-Digit Numbers from 0, 1, and 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Systematic generation and processing of permutations result in meaningful representations of three-digit numbers using the digits 0, 1, and 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Task 4: Building a Simple CSV Reader and Parser\n",
    "\n",
    "The CSV reader and parser successfully parse CSV data into dictionaries, handling missing values appropriately and providing a foundational tool for handling CSV data in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Discussion:\n",
    "\n",
    "The findings from Task 1 underscore the significance of understanding divisibility patterns in random number generation tasks.\n",
    "Task 2 reveals insights into the linguistic characteristics and narrative style of \"Pride and Prejudice\" through text analysis.\n",
    "The systematic approach to permutation generation discussed in Task 3 highlights the efficiency of combinatorial methods in generating all possible combinations.\n",
    "Task 4 demonstrates the importance of efficient data parsing techniques, laying the groundwork for handling structured data such as CSV files.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data analysis and computation techniques, as showcased in the four tasks, offer valuable tools for extracting insights and patterns from diverse datasets.\n",
    "Understanding the methodologies and implications of these techniques is crucial for making informed decisions in research, industry, and academia.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
