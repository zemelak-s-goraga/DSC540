# # Milstone 4: Connecting to an API/Pulling in the Data and Cleaning/Formatting

# # The dataset:
# 
# In this milstone 4 of the term project, the FAOSTAT historical dataset on LiveAnimals was obtained from Kaggle using this API Command (kaggle datasets download -d unitednations/global-food-agriculture-statistics) following the undermentioned procedures. The dataset represent over 200 countries with more than 25 primary products and inputs that were collected in between 1961 to 2013 years. Key variables include in the dataset are Area or Country, Item (Agricult.Products, Cattle, Sheep, Chicken, Crops, etc), Element (Import Quantity, Export Quantity, Import Value, Export Value), Year (1961 â€“ 2013), and Value.

# # 1 paragraph of the ethical implications of data wrangling specific to the datasource 
# 
# 
# Ethical Implications of Data Wrangling for the FAOSTAT Live Animals Dataset:
# 
# In the process of data wrangling the FAOSTAT Live Animals dataset, ethical implications arise concerning data privacy, integrity, and transparency. Given the extensive historical data spanning over 50 years and covering over 200 countries, it is crucial to ensure that the data remains anonymized and that no sensitive information about individuals or specific entities is exposed. The integrity of the data must be maintained by accurately handling outliers and inconsistencies without introducing biases or errors that could misrepresent trends or patterns. Transparency in the data wrangling process is also essential, as stakeholders must be able to trust the methods used to clean and format the data. Clear documentation of the transformations and decisions made during data wrangling ensures that the dataset can be reliably used for further analysis and that the findings derived from it are credible and ethically sound.

# In[ ]:





# # Responses to the questions based on Milestone 4 project activities:
# 
# What changes were made to the data?
# 
# Various data transformation and cleansing steps were applied to the FAOSTAT Live Animals dataset. These steps included replacing headers with more descriptive names, reformatting the data into a more readable structure, identifying and handling outliers and erroneous values, removing duplicate entries, and standardizing inconsistent casing or values across the dataset.
# 
# Are there any legal or regulatory guidelines for your data or project topic?
# 
# The FAOSTAT Live Animals dataset is publicly available and provided by the United Nations, which ensures compliance with international data sharing standards. However, the use of this data must still adhere to general data privacy regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe, ensuring that no personal data is inadvertently disclosed or misused.
# 
# What risks could be created based on the transformations done?
# 
# The transformations could introduce risks such as data distortion if not executed carefully. For instance, improper handling of outliers could lead to the loss of significant data points, and mismanagement of duplicates could result in inflated or deflated statistical analyses. These risks could potentially lead to erroneous conclusions and misinformed decisions based on the dataset.
# 
# Did you make any assumptions in cleaning/transforming the data?
# 
# Yes, certain assumptions were made during the data cleaning process. For example, it was assumed that missing values in specific fields should be treated as nulls rather than zeroes to avoid skewing the data. Additionally, it was assumed that certain inconsistencies in casing and value formatting were unintentional errors rather than meaningful distinctions.
# 
# How was your data sourced/verified for credibility?
# 
# The dataset was sourced from FAOSTAT, a reputable and reliable provider of global food and agriculture statistics managed by the United Nations. The credibility of the data was further verified by cross-referencing key statistics with other authoritative sources in agricultural research to ensure consistency and accuracy.
# 
# Was your data acquired in an ethical way?
# 
# Yes, the data was acquired ethically, following the proper procedures for accessing and using publicly available datasets. The data is openly shared by FAOSTAT for research and analysis purposes, ensuring that the use of this data adheres to ethical standards and promotes transparency.
# 
# How would you mitigate any of the ethical implications you have identified?
# 
# To mitigate ethical implications, several measures can be taken. First, maintaining transparency in the data wrangling process through thorough documentation of all transformations ensures accountability. Second, implementing rigorous validation checks during the data cleaning process helps maintain data integrity. Third, ensuring that any sensitive or potentially identifiable information is anonymized protects privacy. Lastly, adhering to legal and regulatory guidelines while engaging in continuous ethical reviews ensures that the data handling process remains compliant with ethical standards.

# # Short Report on Term Project Milstone 4:
# 
# 
# Milestone 4: Connecting to an API/Pulling in the Data and Cleaning/Formatting
# 
# Summary:
# 
# Milestone 4 involves connecting to an API, pulling in the data, and performing at least five data transformation and cleansing steps to ensure a clean dataset at the end of the milestone. The Kaggle API data was subjected to various transformation techniques such as replacing headers, formatting data into a more readable format, identifying outliers, finding duplicates, and fixing casing or inconsistent values.
# 
# Introduction:
# 
# Data obtained from APIs often require cleaning and formatting to prepare them for analysis. In this milestone 4, I connected to Kaggle API and pulled the LiveAnimals Dataset by applying various transformation techniques to ensure the dataset is clean, consistent, and formatted correctly. By performing these steps, I aimed to improve the quality and reliability of the data for subsequent analysis.
# 
# Statement of the Problem:
# 
# The data obtained from the API may contain errors, inconsistencies, or missing values that could affect the accuracy of the analysis. Therefore, it is essential to perform data cleaning and formatting to ensure the dataset is reliable and suitable for analysis. Ethical considerations such as data privacy, integrity, and transparency must be upheld throughout the data wrangling process.
# 
# About the Dataset:
# 
# In this Milestone 4 of the term project, the FAOSTAT historical dataset on Live Animals was obtained from Kaggle using this API Command: kaggle datasets download -d unitednations/global-food-agriculture-statistics. The dataset represents over 200 countries with more than 25 primary products and inputs collected between 1961 and 2013. Key variables in the dataset include Area or Country, Item (Agricultural Products, Cattle, Sheep, Chicken, Crops, etc.), Element (Import Quantity, Export Quantity, Import Value, Export Value), Year (1961 â€“ 2013), and Value.
# 
# Methodology:
# 
# More than 10 data transformation and cleansing steps were applied to the API data:
# 
# Replacing Headers: Standardized the headers to ensure they are descriptive and consistent.
# Formatting Data: Reformatted data into a more readable and consistent structure.
# Identifying Outliers: Detected and handled outliers to maintain data integrity.
# Finding Duplicates: Identified and removed duplicate entries to ensure data accuracy.
# Fixing Casing/Inconsistent Values: Corrected casing issues and ensured uniformity in data values.
# & others.
# 
# Each step was clearly labeled and described to provide transparency and clarity in the data wrangling process.
# 
# 
# Results:
# 
# Upon completion of the data transformation and cleansing steps, the API dataset was clean, consistent, and formatted correctly. The human-readable dataset printed at the end of the milestone demonstrated the effectiveness of the applied transformations, with improved readability and accuracy. The dataset is now ready for further analysis in subsequent milestones.
# 
# Discussion:
# 
# The data transformation and cleansing steps are essential for ensuring the integrity and reliability of the dataset. By addressing issues such as outliers, duplicates, and inconsistent values, I improved the quality of the data and minimized the risk of erroneous conclusions. Ethical implications such as data privacy and integrity were carefully considered throughout the process to uphold ethical standards and maintain trust in the analysis.
# 
# Conclusion:
# 
# In conclusion, the data transformation and cleansing steps applied in this milestone played a crucial role in preparing the API dataset for analysis. By identifying and addressing issues such as outliers, duplicates, and inconsistent values, I ensured the dataset is clean, consistent, and ready for further exploration. Moving forward, the clean dataset will serve as the foundation for subsequent analyses and insights in the project.
# 
# The Way Forward:
# 
# The next steps will involve conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization to gain insights into the relationships and patterns within the dataset. By analyzing the cleaned dataset, I can uncover trends, correlations, and anomalies that provide valuable insights into the subject area. Ethical considerations will continue to be prioritized, with a focus on maintaining data privacy, integrity, and transparency throughout the analysis process.
